Hello there!

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of my projects developed over the past year, showcasing my backend skills. I've put in a great deal of effort to follow industry best practices, adhering to SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles. Additionally, I prioritize writing comprehensive unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

Feel free to explore my repository and delve into the codebase. 
If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

### artmarket
In this directory, you can explore the unit tests, which include both functional and unit tests. The controllers present here are dedicated to handling requests and nothing else. The logic is structured into services, dictionaries, and DTOs. My focus during the development was primarily on the backend, as I incorporated the Vue.js frontend later on.

### warmupData
I have implemented a feature in an online browser game that facilitates "data warming up". Upon loading the page, users will no longer need to send additional requests to the database. Instead, the data will be fetched from the preloaded/warm-up classes.

### eth-accounts-farm
The tool was developed with Laravel framework in one week. It works with the Ethereum blockchain and provides the following features: creating wallets, checking the balance of accounts, detecting specific transactions, and creating unsigned transactions through an API. After the accounts are created, they can sign and send the transactions.
